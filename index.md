Hi!
I am Carl Simon Adorf, a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor.
My research under Sharon C. Glotzer is driven by the goal to create *soft matter materials by design*.

As part of my research, I work as a soft engineer, contributing to the general-purpose particle simulation toolkit **HOOMD-blue**.
I am the lead-developer of the open-source data management framework **signac**, supporting the scientific community in the application of best-practices in scientific computing.

I am lucky enough to live in the beautiful town of Ann Arbor, which I often explore via biking or running.
You will also find me enjoying the soundtrack of Hamilton or techno music in my spare time.
