Hi! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor.
The research I conduct under [Sharon C. Glotzer](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home), is focused on data-driven design of novel *soft matter materials*.

As part of my research, I am the lead-developer of the open-source data management framework **[signac](http://www.signac.io)**, supporting the scientific community in the application of best-practices in scientific computing.
As a contributor to the general-purpose particle simulation toolkit **[HOOMD-Blue](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue)**, I strive to make **signac** highly integrable with compute-intensive simulation workflows on leadership-class supercomputers.
