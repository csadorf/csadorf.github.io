My research is targeted at the **self-assembly of soft matter materials** with specific target properties.
Self-assembly in this context means the emergence of structure and other properties purely through free energy minimization, governed by energetic and entropic contributions.
But even in the complete absence of energetic interactions, structure will emerge under specific conditions through maximization of entropy alone.

This means that nano particles with specific shape and optionally functionalized surfaces can self-assemblye into simple to very complex structures.
This provides an enormous potential to design building blocks with pre-determined, targeted self-assembly behavior.
This **Materials Inverse Design Problem** *the determination of building blocks that self-asemble into phases with targeted structure and properties*, is largely limited by the vast parameter space.
