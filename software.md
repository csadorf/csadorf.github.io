<h1><b>signac</b></h1>

I am the lead developer of the data management framework **signac**.
It is designed to assist users in managing large and heterogenous data spaces.

The signac framework provides a simple and robust data model to create well-defined data spaces.
This makes it easy to operate on large and complex data spaces, and streamlines workflow development.
Finally, a well-defined data space makes data collectively more accessible.

The package is documented on [readthedocs][2] and maintained in a [bitbucket repository][1].
A set of [jupyter notebooks][3] serve as examples and tutorial.

I have contributed to HOOMD-blue, a general-purpose simulation toolkit which scales from a single CPU to thousands of GPUs.
HOOMD-blue is a general-purpose simulation toolkit which scales from a single CPU to thousands of GPU's.
The impact this tool has on the particle simulation and soft matter community is reflected in the high number of [publications][4].
