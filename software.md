<h1><b>signac</b></h1>

I am the lead developer of the data management framework [**signac**][1].
The signac framework supports researchers in managing project-related data by providing a well-defined, indexable layout for storing file-based data and metadata directly on the filesystem.
In this way, signac enables efficient data access through an ad hoc database-like interface without the need for running a server.

The distributed file-based storage model is well-suited to high-performance computing applications.
Additionally, signac aids in defining and executing workflows for operating on these managed data spaces both on local workstations and on leadership-class supercomputers.

I have contributed to HOOMD-blue, a general-purpose simulation toolkit which scales from a single CPU to thousands of GPUs.
HOOMD-blue is a general-purpose simulation toolkit which scales from a single CPU to thousands of GPU's.
The impact this tool has on the particle simulation and soft matter community is reflected in the high number of [publications][4].
